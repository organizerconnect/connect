# Due to issues with some packages compiling on dev machines we break out
# requirements that are needed on Heroku (requirements.txt), on dev machines
# (dev-requirements.txt), and for documentation (doc-requirements.txt)


# cffi or cryptography have to be explictly set in requirements for heroku
# python buildpack to install the relevant libraries
cffi==1.5.2


# pylibmc has to be explictly added to requirements for heroku's python
# buildpack
pylibmc==1.4.3


# Since we don't want to require libmemcached on dev machines, only require
# packages that need memcached on heroku
django-heroku-memcacheify==0.8


# We include the gunicorn-related packages in this file as they don't compile
# well outside of heroku
